# PHP Yify (YTS.AM) API

A simple Object Oriented wrapper for Yify (YTS.AM) API, written with PHP.

Uses [Yify API](https://yts.am/api). The object API is very similar to the RESTful API.

## Features

* PSR 6 Cache Pool
* Light and fast thanks to lazy loading of API classes
* Extensively tested and documented

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.6
* A [HTTP client](https://packagist.org/providers/php-http/client-implementation)
* A [PSR-7 implementation](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-message-implementation)
* (optional) PHPUnit to run tests.

## Install

Via Composer:

```bash
$ composer require tnhnclskn/yify-api
```

Why `php-http/guzzle6-adapter`? We are decoupled from any HTTP messaging client with help by [HTTPlug](http://httplug.io/).

## Basic usage of `php-yify-api` client

```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new \YifyAPI\YifyAPI();
$response = $client->listMovies();
$movies = $response->movies;
```

From `$client` object, you can access to all YifyAPI.
